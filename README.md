# Diabetes Dataset Analysis and Visualization

## Overview
This project involves analyzing and visualizing the **Diabetes dataset** to explore relationships among features and understand the dataset's structure. The dataset contains information related to diabetes prediction.

---

## Features of the Dataset
- **Pregnancies**: Number of pregnancies.
- **Glucose**: Plasma glucose concentration.
- **BloodPressure**: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg).
- **SkinThickness**: Triceps skinfold thickness (mm).
- **Insulin**: 2-hour serum insulin (mu U/ml).
- **BMI**: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2).
- **DiabetesPedigreeFunction**: A measure of hereditary risk for diabetes.
- **Age**: Age of the individual.
- **Outcome**: Target variable (1 = Diabetes, 0 = No Diabetes).

## Project Steps

### 1. Importing Libraries
Essential libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn` were used for data manipulation and visualization.

### 2. Data Loading
The dataset is loaded using `pandas` from a `.csv` file.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis
- Displayed dataset structure using `.head()`, `.columns`, and `.dtypes`.
- Checked for missing values using `.isnull().sum()`.

### 4. Data Visualization
- **Correlation Matrix**: Generated using `sns.heatmap` to understand relationships between features.
- **Distribution Plots**: Visualized the distribution of features using seaborn plots (`displot` or `histplot`).
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Summarized the dataset using `.describe()`.

### 5. Data Imputation
Addressed zero values in features like **BloodPressure**, **SkinThickness**, **Insulin**, and **BMI** by replacing them with mean or median values as appropriate.

## Output
- **Heatmap**: Correlation heatmap to analyze feature relationships.
- **Feature Distributions**: Visualized distributions for features such as **Pregnancies**, **Glucose**, **Insulin**, etc.
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Provided insights into the central tendency and spread of the data.

---

## Tools and Libraries
- **Python Libraries**: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`.
- **Environment**: Google Colab.

---

## Notes
- This project focuses on data preprocessing and visualization to gain insights into the dataset.
- Further steps, such as building a machine learning model for diabetes prediction, can be integrated into this project.
